# [Kiln](https://www.kiln.fi/) Swap Optimize Secure - Hackathon Project üíª


üëã Welcome to our project for [Kiln #1 Hackathon](https://www.kiln.fi/kiln-hackathon), held from January 31 to February 2, 2025, at the Kiln Office in **Paris**.

The goal was to create a project around [Kiln products](https://pitch.com/v/kilns-first-hackathon-welcome-j9hhy7/bbc26246-cd72-4ee3-83a7-19a8cec75c99), specifically :
- **Widget**: Seamless and customizable interface for staking and earning rewards directly in Kiln platform. 
- **DeFi**: Access to leading DeFi protocols, enabling them to earn rewards on various assets through a unified and automated on-chain solution
- Connect: Manage staking accounts programmatically, craft and broadcast transactions, and monitor real-time rewards and validator performance across multiple Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks
- Validator: Ensure enterprise-grade infrastructure for staking operations, benefiting from Kiln's expertise in managing validators across various PoS chains.
- OnChain: An audited suite of smart contracts that enables platforms to offer fully branded, customizable, non-custodial Ethereum staking to end-users, with automated rewards dispatch and optional transferability capabilities.
- Dashboard: A comprehensive web interface that allows users to stake assets across major PoS chains with a single click, monitor rewards, manage team accounts, and generate detailed reports.

We decided to worked on **Widget** and **DeFi** themes.

## Our product
We built SOS for **Swap.Optimize.Secure**. We have extended the Vault Deposit process to allow for the management of off-chain financial products underwitten with CeFi or DeFi entities and used to hedge currency risks.
Added on top of Kiln Widget, an option offers the investor the oppportunity to access the highest yield in DeFi expressed in their preferred domestic currency.
Investors can :
- deposit any token in the vault,
- select the underlying DeFi investment vault,
- **choose the stablecoin used to hedge their currency exposure** and paid at withdrawal.

## Our work ‚öôÔ∏è
- Contracts (OracleForward, ReserveFactory, Vault (Reserve part + little modification)).
- [Front-end](https://davphla.github.io/kiln-sos/) - Reproduced and modified interface to show the integration of our project.
- Back-end (Bank simulation) - Simulate to work with Oracle (Not used).
