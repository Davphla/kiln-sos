# [Kiln](https://www.kiln.fi/) Swap Optimize Secure - Hackathon Project üíª


üëã Welcome to our project for [Kiln #1 Hackathon](https://www.kiln.fi/kiln-hackathon), held from January 31 to February 2, 2025, at the Kiln Office in **Paris**.

The goal was to create a project around [Kiln products]((https://pitch.com/v/kilns-first-hackathon-welcome-j9hhy7/bbc26246-cd72-4ee3-83a7-19a8cec75c99)), specifically :
- **Widget**: Seamless and customizable interface for staking and earning rewards directly in Kiln platform. 
- **DeFi**: Access to leading DeFi protocols, enabling them to earn rewards on various assets through a unified and automated on-chain solution
- Connect: Manage staking accounts programmatically, craft and broadcast transactions, and monitor real-time rewards and validator performance across multiple Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks
- Validator: Ensure enterprise-grade infrastructure for staking operations, benefiting from Kiln's expertise in managing validators across various PoS chains.
- OnChain: An audited suite of smart contracts that enables platforms to offer fully branded, customizable, non-custodial Ethereum staking to end-users, with automated rewards dispatch and optional transferability capabilities.
- Dashboard: A comprehensive web interface that allows users to stake assets across major PoS chains with a single click, monitor rewards, manage team accounts, and generate detailed reports.

We decided to worked on **Widget** and **DeFi** themes.
